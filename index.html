        <p>These network diagrams represent relationships between composers in several settings (e.g., the Texas UIL Band Prescribed Music List (PML), the Midwest Clinic) as seen through their overall representation within each resource or event. Thicker lines represent more works and individuals near the center of the graph are more highly connected across groupings, representing more total works.</p>

        <h3>Texas Prescribed Music List</h3>

        <p><ul><li><a href="TXPML_Grades.html">PML Network Graph</a></li><b>NOTE:</b> The 'half' grades found in the diagram (e.g., 1.5, 2.5) represent works that appear at several different difficulty levels on the list. These works are generally multi-movement, and playing individual segments or a selection is counted as a lesser difficulty to the entire work. These were averaged together to capture the breadth of their appearance without distorting the tally of works by a given composer.</ul></p>

        <h3>2021 Midwest Clinic Ensembles & Composers</h3>

        <p>This graph represents ongoing research and will receive occasional, likely infrequent, updates. The author will not provide a changelog on this site, but interested parties are welcome to peruse my GitHub repository for detailed information.  </p>
